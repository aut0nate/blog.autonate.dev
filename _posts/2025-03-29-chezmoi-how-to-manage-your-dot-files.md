Managing configuration files across multiple systems can quickly become a mess. From terminal preferences to shell settings, we all have a finely-tuned setup that we rely on day-to-day. But how do you keep those settings consistent across machines? And how do you avoid the chaos of losing them after a reinstall?

That’s where a tool like [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) comes in.

## What is Chezmoi?

Chezmoi is a powerful dotfile manager designed to track, version, and securely deploy your configuration files across multiple operating systems. It helps you manage configuration files such as `~/.zshrc`, `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.config/` and more — all with a simple Git workflow.

Unlike traditional symlink managers like GNU Stow, Chezmoi works by maintaining a source state in a Git repository, which it applies to your home directory. This means you can track your dotfiles like code, safely test changes, and even add logic for different operating systems or hosts.

## Getting Started

To get started with Chezmoi, [install](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/) it using your preferred package manager.

On macOS:

```bash
brew install chezmoi
```

Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install chezmoi
```

Windows:

```bash
winget install twpayne.chezmoi
```

Then initialise your dotfiles repository:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply aut0nate
```

This command clones your dotfiles repository (e.g. [https://github.com/aut0nate/dotfiles](https://github.com/aut0nate/dotfiles)) and immediately applies the configuration to your home directory. You can also start fresh by running:

```bash
chezmoi init
```

And then begin adding files:

```bash
chezmoi add ~/.zshrc
chezmoi add ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

## The Power of Templates

One of Chezmoi’s most useful features is its powerful templating engine. You can create conditional logic in your config files using [Go templating syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

For example, let’s say you want a slightly different `.zshrc` on macOS vs Linux:

```zsh
{{ if eq .os "darwin" }}
echo "Running on macOS"
{{ else if eq .os "linux" }}
echo "Running on Linux"
{{ end }}
```

You can also target OS-specific files by using suffixes in your source directory:

``` bash
~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_zshrc.tmpl
~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_gitconfig.tmpl
```

Or host-specific files:

``` bash
dot_gitconfig.tmpl
  └── applies to all systems

dot_gitconfig@workmachine.tmpl
  └── only applies when the hostname is 'workmachine'
```

This allows you to have one unified repository that works intelligently across every system you manage. To learn more about templates in Chezmoi [click here](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/templating/).

## Why Backing Up Config Files Matters

Your dotfiles represent hours — if not years — of customisation. Losing them can feel like losing a part of your workflow.

By using Chezmoi with Git, you:

- **Track every change** you make to your configs
- **Back up your entire setup** to GitHub or another Git provider
- **Easily restore your environment** after a system wipe or when setting up a new machine
- **Reduce time spent reconfiguring** new environments

Your dotfiles essentially become portable, versioned, and secure — which is especially useful if you work across macOS, Linux, or WSL environments.

## My Dotfiles

If you're curious, you can check out [my dotfiles on GitHub](https://github.com/aut0nate/dotfiles). Feel free to fork, clone, or use it for inspiration.

## Final Thoughts

Chezmoi has quickly become one of my essential tools. It removes the friction of managing dotfiles and adds the confidence of knowing my setup is always a `chezmoi init` away.

Whether you're just getting started or looking to level up your dotfile game, Chezmoi is a great place to begin.
