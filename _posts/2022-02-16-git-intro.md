I’ve been diving deeper into Git recently, using it daily in my current role compared to just every other day in previous positions. While I’ve been comfortable with the core Git commands for a while, my current role has pushed me to explore more advanced Git concepts and techniques.

I thought it would be useful to compile this guide as a reference, both for myself and for anyone else looking to sharpen their Git skills.

## What is Git

Git is a distributed version control system, widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. Git is essential for managing software development projects, providing tools to collaborate, track progress, and ensure the codebase's integrity.

## Why Use Git?

When developing software or working on any project involving code or text files, it’s common to need a history of your changes or even to revert to earlier versions. Git excels in version control, which allows you to:

- **Collaborate**: Multiple people can work on a project simultaneously.
- **Track Changes**: Every modification to your project files can be tracked.
- **Branching**: Developers can create independent branches of code to work on features separately.
- **Reverting**: If something goes wrong, Git allows you to revert to previous versions.

Git's power lies in its simplicity and flexibility, allowing both solo developers and teams to work more efficiently. Now, let's dive into some of the most commonly used Git commands.
