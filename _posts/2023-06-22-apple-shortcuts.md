When people think of iPhones, they often picture sleek hardware and user-friendly software. Of course, if you’re team Android, that’s perfectly fine—there’s no room for tribalism here. But I digress. Back to the topic at hand: one of iOS’s most underrated features is hiding in plain sight—Apple Shortcuts. This powerful app allows you to automate tasks, saving time and effort on repetitive actions. Yet despite its incredible potential, many iPhone users either tuck it away in a folder or remove it entirely.

## What Are Apple Shortcuts?  

Apple Shortcuts is an automation app available on iOS that allows you to create workflows combining multiple actions. These workflows, called **shortcuts**, can be triggered with a tap, a Siri command, or even automatically in response to certain conditions.  

Think of it as your personal automation assistant: if you do something repeatedly, chances are Shortcuts can make it faster, easier, or entirely hands-free.

## Why I Use Apple Shortcuts  

For me, Shortcuts is more than just a utility—it’s a way to streamline my life. I use it to:  

- **Control smart devices**: From turning on smart plugs to adjusting lights, I’ve created shortcuts that integrate seamlessly with my smart home setup.  
- **Interact with APIs**: Shortcuts can connect with APIs to retrieve data or perform actions, making it perfect for tech-savvy users who want more control.  
- **Automate text messages**: I’ve built shortcuts to send recurring texts at specific times, saving me from typing the same messages over and over again.  

Whether you’re a casual user or a tech enthusiast, Shortcuts has something for everyone.  

## Why Shortcuts Is Underrated  

Shortcuts remains a niche app despite its incredible potential. The problem isn’t the app itself but its visibility: many iPhone users don’t realise what it can do. Apple hasn’t fully showcased its capabilities, and without exploration, most people miss out on its value.  

Additionally, the learning curve can seem steep. But the beauty of Shortcuts is its scalability—you can start small with simple single-action shortcuts and build your way up to more advanced workflows over time.

## Simple vs Advanced Shortcuts  

- **Simple Shortcuts**: These consist of a single action, like creating a shortcut to call a specific contact or send a text with a tap.  
- **Advanced Shortcuts**: These combine multiple actions. For example, you could create a shortcut that:  
  1. Retrieves the weather for your location.  
  2. Calculates your commute time.  
  3. Sends a text to let someone know when you’ll arrive.  

The possibilities are endless, and once you start building shortcuts, you’ll begin spotting more opportunities to automate your life.

## Getting Started  

Here are some examples of shortcuts you might try:  

- **Set a Morning Routine**: Automatically start your favourite playlist, adjust your smart lights, and get the weather forecast with one command.  
- **Log Your Expenses**: Add a shortcut to quickly input expenses into a spreadsheet or finance app.  
- **Quick Texts**: Automate sending common responses like “On my way!” or “I’ll call you back.”
