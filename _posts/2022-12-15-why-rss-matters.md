In the age of social media algorithms, personalised feeds, and endless scrolling, it might seem odd to rely on an older technology like RSS to stay informed. But for me, RSS remains one of the best ways to stay on top of my interests without the noise and distractions of modern platforms. Here's why I still use RSS after all these years, how it helps me cut through the clutter, and why I prefer it over social media algorithms.

## What Is RSS?  

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a standardised way for websites to share their content. It allows users to subscribe to feeds from their favourite websites, blogs, or news outlets and get updates delivered directly to an RSS reader. It’s like having your own curated newspaper, but one where you decide exactly what’s included.

## Why RSS Matters in the Age of Social Media

Social media platforms promise to keep us updated, but they come with significant downsides:  

1. **Algorithms Control What You See**  
   Social media algorithms decide what content appears in your feed, prioritising engagement over relevance. This often means you see sensational or popular content instead of the topics you care about most. RSS flips this dynamic on its head, putting you in control of your feed.  

2. **No Distractions or Ads**  
   RSS readers are distraction-free. Unlike social media, where content is sandwiched between ads and endless suggestions, RSS presents updates in a clean, uncluttered way.  

3. **Privacy and Ownership**  
   With RSS, you don’t need to log into a platform or give away your data. It’s a decentralised system that respects your privacy and puts you in control of your information flow.  

## How I Use RSS to Stay on Top of My Interests  

I subscribe to feeds from blogs, news sites, and forums that align with my interests. The beauty of RSS is that I get every update from these sources without relying on algorithms to decide what’s “important.”  

To take it a step further, I use **regex filters** to refine the content I see. Regex (regular expressions) is a powerful way to include or exclude specific topics from my feeds. For example:  

- I can filter out articles containing keywords I don’t care about (e.g., “celebrity” or “rumour”).  
- I can prioritise posts that include topics of interest (e.g., “Fedora” or “Linux commands”).  

This filtering helps me focus on the content that truly matters while ignoring the rest. It’s like creating a personalised information pipeline that delivers exactly what I need.

## Why I Use Inoreader  

When it comes to RSS readers, **Inoreader** is my preferred choice. It offers an intuitive interface, powerful filtering tools, and features that go beyond basic RSS functionality. Here’s why I love it:  

- **Regex Filtering**: Inoreader makes it easy to apply regex filters, allowing me to customise my feeds with precision.  
- **Searchable Archives**: Inoreader keeps a full history of my subscriptions, so I can search for articles long after they’ve left the feed.  
- **Cross-Platform Access**: I can access my feeds on any device, whether I’m on my desktop or mobile.

## The Power of Control  

Ultimately, RSS gives me what social media never could: control. It allows me to decide what’s important, filter out distractions, and stay focused on the topics that matter most. In a world of endless feeds and algorithmic echo chambers, RSS feels like a breath of fresh air.  

If you’ve never tried RSS, or if you abandoned it for social media years ago, I encourage you to give it another shot. It might just transform the way you stay informed and free you from the algorithm.

## Final Thoughts

RSS might not be trendy, but it’s powerful, reliable, and refreshingly free from manipulation. In a digital world shaped by engagement metrics and attention economics, reclaiming control over how we consume information is more important than ever.

Whether you're a seasoned RSS user or just discovering it, there's something liberating about building your own feed—tailored to your interests, free from distractions, and respectful of your privacy. For me, it’s become an essential part of my daily routine.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the noise of modern platforms, give RSS another look. You might be surprised by how much calmer and more intentional your information diet becomes.
