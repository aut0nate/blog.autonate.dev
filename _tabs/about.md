👋🏻 Hi, I’m Nathan, a technical professional from the UK with a passion for exploring the evolving world of technology. My areas of interest include **AI**, **Automation**, **System Administration**, **Cloud Computing**, and **DevOps**.

## Why This Blog?

I created this blog to document my journey through the ever-changing landscape of technology and to share what I learn along the way. Here, you’ll find guides, tutorials, insights, and recommendations across a wide range of technical subjects that I am actively exploring, including:

- **AI** – Delving into Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, and more.
- **Automation** – Creating and sharing scripts and automations using various tools.
- **System Administration** – Tips and tricks for managing Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
- **Cloud Computing** – Insights and experiments with Azure Services.
- **Software & Tools** – Discovering and sharing new software, tools, and utilities.

This blog is not just a space for me to organise my technical knowledge but also a resource for others. Whether you’re seeking software recommendations, time-saving automations, AI developments, or Linux command guides, I hope you’ll find something useful here.

## My Interests

Outside of the tech world, I have a passion for:

- **Photography** – Capturing moments and exploring creative perspectives.
- **History** – Delving into the past, particularly the 19th and 20th centuries.
- **Travel** – Exploring new cultures and destinations around the world.
